# My dotfiles repo

## For saving my changes in my dotfiles

I store all my dotfiles under the same directory in ~/.dotfiles/\*
The next thing is to symlink everything to its own places.
For that, you can check the docs of every piece of software, or you can look into the installing scripts in my setup_install repository. There you'll also find some other stuff that I use in my everyday config.

### TODO

- Urgent! Link to gtk theme

- Notification manager
- WOFI and else
- EWW
